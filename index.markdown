Hi, my name is Ed.
I am desktop developer with 5 years experience working on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
I work mostly with C++ and Qt, but teach Python to beginner programmers as well.
I'm big into meetups and always looking for new projects.
I live in Toronto and hang out in a few slacks:
* code-mentoring
* cpplang
* pythondev
